# What does this plugin do?
This plugin is an extension to the [Cockpit Project](https://cockpit-project.org/). It allows you to manage your Samba shares through the Cockpit Project user interface.

# Before you begin (words of warning)
This plugin is very rough around the edges. It's written in a short amount of time, by someone that has not coded in a very long time and is not familiar with the structure and internal workings of the Cockpit Project GUI. However, it does seem to do what I want it to do. 

If you want to improve some pieces of code, or test it, just let me know, or request a merge of your code. I am more than happy to test your changes and merge them in. The HTML code can use a serious cleanup though.

Use this plugin at your own risk.

# Requirements

## Compatibility

Compatibility of older versions is not guaranteed once the version is end of lifecycle. This plugin is tested on:

## Samba
You will need Samba installed. (The automatic install script will check this.)

```
sudo apt-get install samba
```

## Cockpit Project
As this is a Cockpit plugin, you will need that as well. (The automatic install script will check this.)

```
sudo apt-get install cockpit
```

# Installation

## Disable sudo password
On Ubuntu 18.04 LTS you need to provide your sudo password at all times. This seems to be a problem for Cockpit. To disable this you can create an additional file in the '/etc/sudoers.d/' folder to allow this.
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "$(logname) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/cockpit-smb'
```
Or if you want to create these yourself:
```
sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/cockpit-smb
```
Add the following line:
```
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

## Raspbian buster (July 2019)
When I was looking at the Raspberry Pi 4, I noticed that the base operating system of Raspbian is bumped to Debian Buster. By default the Project Cockpit version is still 188-1 (July 2019), installing this version will break Raspbian. Version 196-1 will work, but at the moment of writing this version is still only found in [unstable / testing](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=cockpit).

To enable this version add the following line to the repository and update.
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://ftp.it.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
sudo apt update
```
If you recieve an error about keys, you can request the keys from pgpkeys.mit.edu.
```
gpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key  04EE7237B7D453EC
gpg -a --export 04EE7237B7D453EC | sudo apt-key add -
```
To verify that you will install the correct version, you can query the cache policy. 
```
apt-cache policy cockpit
```
This should show version 198-1 as being a candidate to be installed.
```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ apt-cache policy cockpit
cockpit:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 198-1
  Version table:
     198-1 500
        500 http://ftp.it.debian.org/debian unstable/main armhf Packages
     188-1 500
        500 http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian buster/main armhf Packages
```
If the version works out, you can install cockpit.
```
sudo apt install cockpit
```

## Automatic install 
Just run the following command to let a script to download the files and install the software. This method of installing is recommended.
The automatic install script will figure out if you are running a previous version and which version to apply. As Project Cockpit moves pretty fast, there is a huge version gap between operating systems. 
```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enira/cockpit-smb-plugin/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

## Manual install
Create the Cockpit plugin folder and download the code. The manual install only works with the last tested version of Project Cockpit.
```
sudo mkdir /usr/share/cockpit/smb

sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enira/cockpit-smb-plugin/master/index.html -O /usr/share/cockpit/smb/index.html
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enira/cockpit-smb-plugin/master/manifest.json -O /usr/share/cockpit/smb/manifest.json
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enira/cockpit-smb-plugin/master/smb.js -O /usr/share/cockpit/smb/smb.js
```
